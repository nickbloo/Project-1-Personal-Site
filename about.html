            <p id="about-text1">My interest in programming began from a desire to learn more about modern infastructure. I have experience building websites and apps in:
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>React</li>
                </ul>
            I am always learning new things and I pride myself on my ability to pick up new languages and create functional and practical apps with them.</p>

            <img id="about-img2" class="about-img" src="about02.jpeg" alt="A tribal gathering">
            <p id="about-text2">Besides programming, I am an active member of the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma. Originally from Illinois, we are a small Indian tribe with less than 4,000 members. I have spent a lot of time writing proposals for the Council to review, all of which have been aimed at improving life for the average citizen.</p>
            <p id="about-text2">I have also spent a lot of time doing volunteer work for my tribe. I spent several days cleaning the headstones at our tribal cemetery and I have also filmed several tribal gatherings. My work with my tribe is extremely rewarding and I aim to continue it into the future.</p>

            <h1>Creative Work</h1>
            <img id="about-img3" class="about-img" src="about03.png" alt="My creative work">
            <p id="about-text3">In addition to tribal work I have also done a lot of creative work in the past! Art has always been a passion of mine. I have made many short films, painted, crafted Native American jewelry, written and self-published my own book. I even performed magic as a child, if you can believe it (I was on the news once)!</p>
